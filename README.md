# Glasgow-Blatchford-Bleeding-Score
Python code implementation of the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score (GBS) calculation based on the criteria for actual conditions.
This code prompts the user to input the required variables such as urea, hemoglobin, systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and presence of melena (black, tarry stool). It then calculates the Glasgow-Blatchford Bleeding Score based on the provided inputs.

Please note that this is a basic implementation of the scoring calculation and may not include all the nuances and additional criteria that could be present in a comprehensive clinical implementation. It's always important to consult medical professionals and use validated tools in real-world scenarios.
